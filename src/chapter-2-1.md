AI and machine learning have become increasingly prevalent in human resource management in recent years. However, the history of AI and machine learning in HR can be traced back to several decades ago. In this chapter, we will provide a historical overview of AI and machine learning in HR.

## Early Applications of AI in HR

The early applications of AI in HR can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s when researchers began developing computer programs to automate routine tasks such as payroll processing and benefits administration. These early systems were limited in their capabilities and did not use advanced algorithms or machine learning techniques.

## Emergence of Machine Learning in HR

The emergence of machine learning in HR can be traced back to the 1980s when researchers began using statistical models and algorithms to analyze employee data and identify patterns. For example, machine learning was used to predict employee turnover by analyzing factors such as job satisfaction, performance, and tenure.

## Evolution of AI in HR

In the 1990s, AI and machine learning technologies began to evolve rapidly, leading to the development of more sophisticated HR systems. One of the key developments during this period was the use of natural language processing (NLP) to analyze unstructured data such as resumes and job descriptions. This allowed recruiters to quickly and accurately screen large volumes of candidate data.

## Modern Applications of AI in HR

Today, AI and machine learning are increasingly being used in HR for a variety of applications such as talent acquisition, employee engagement, and analytics. For example, AI-powered chatbots can provide automated responses to candidate inquiries, while predictive analytics can be used to identify employees who are at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, the history of AI and machine learning in HR can be traced back several decades. From early applications such as payroll processing to modern applications such as candidate screening and employee retention, AI and machine learning have become integral tools in human resource management. As AI and machine learning technologies continue to evolve, it's important for organizations to stay informed and proactive in integrating these technologies into their HR strategies to achieve greater success in talent acquisition and retention efforts.
